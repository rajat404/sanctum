### Should you unfollow me?

Absolutely!

If the content I've been posting isn't something you feel like consuming, go ahead and unfollow.

Our paths are likely to meet again at some point ðŸ¤ž

### Should you mute me?

I'd rather you don't ðŸ˜…

Feel free to unfollow. Muting closes doors to the possibility of any interaction in future.

### Should you follow me?

Give it a shot. Nothing to lose. You can always unfollow ðŸ˜‰

### What won't I post?

Starting quite recently, I refrain from tweeting about politics, religion, or whatever the headlines are saying in any given news cycle.

Twitter has a variety of channels for consuming information pertaining to current affairs - me not retweeting about the dangerously rising COVID-19 deaths doesn't mean the information won't reach the people who need it.

### What will I post?

I'm a digital nomad who tends to stumble upon shiny things in the interwebs and is likely to hoard them. I mostly post about such stuff.

Some other topics I tweet about - software development, productivity,  mental health, human behaviour, organizational psychology.

Needless to say I do log a lot of my thoughts & life events on twitter. The frequency usually depends on how busy I've been at a given point in time.
