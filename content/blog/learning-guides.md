As I was curating my github stars (~250 at the time of writing), I found a lot of study guides, resources, list of tools etc, which I've seldom used due to the sheer volume of my [hoarded links]({{< ref "fomo.md" >}}). Anyhow, I figured someone else might put them to better use. So here's the list, hope it helps.
