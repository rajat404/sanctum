I had hundreds of videos in my Youtube account's `Watch Later` list.
Trouble is that there are lot of restrictions on this special list, and there is no option to move videos to another playlist in bulk.

So after searching a lot on the interwebs, I came across this brilliant hack: https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/i4oxuc/youtube_watch_later_playlist_move/

Now there is no direct way to delete all videos from the `Watch Later` list, but fortunately there is a hack for that as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/i4oxuc/youtube_watch_later_playlist_move/ggfodf4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
